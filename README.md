<h2>Backend Server for GeoVibes</h2>

As of 03-03-2023, this project still reflects the work done when following the book found at zero2prod.com.
This book, by Luca Palmieri, serves as an excellent template and a foundation for learning.

When all objectives from this learning path are complete, the code will be zipped up for safekeeping. Next, this repo's code 
will be heavily altered to serve as a reliable backend server for GeoVibes, our upcoming mobile app.
