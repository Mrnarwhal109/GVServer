<h2>Backend server for GeoVibes</h2>

As of 03-03-2023, this project still reflects the work done as part of the journey through the book by Luca Palmieri found through zero2prod.com.

When all objectives from this learning path are complete, the code will be zipped up for safekeeping and this repo's code 
will be heavily altered to serve as a reliable backend server for GeoVibes, our upcoming mobile app.

The zero2prod guide will serve as an excellent template and a foundation for learning.
